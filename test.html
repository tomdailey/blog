	<p>I don't know exactly what I'd like to say in all of this, I just want to get into the flow of it. The thing is, I need to somehow produce at the same time that I learn. There's a strange economic scenario facing the person who wants to dedicate their time to learning-- and that's their inevitable necesity to contribute to something to maintain a their standard of living. I have to contribute.</p>
	<p>The other part is that I know the contribution is more important than what I learn, than I learn in order to make the best contribution I can, but thinking of it that way allows for a cop out. See, I could tell myself that it's more important to write a good optimistic blog for people struggling to realize their acedemic goals, but then any success I find wouldn't be the sucess I'd be trying to teach my readers.</p>
	<p>There's a disconect between the modern successful blogger and the actual reader, expecially when the blog is about life-- because the succesful blogger lives in a fantasy land where contribution is just dependant on reputation momentum, and consistency is enough for success. They aren't really doing the hard part anymore.</p>
	<p></br>This was longer than I expected it to be. Anyway, good luck</p>
