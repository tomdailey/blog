<h1>This</h1>
<p>Is something I'm working on. I'm don't have a good enough idea of it to really want to summarize it here, so I won't.</p>
<p>But in the mean time, I might as well fill this page with some more text. I figure to do this I could occupy the middle ground between writing real, coherent sentances, and just blabbering meaninglessness. There's a strange Zen to this, and I encourage you to try it sometime. (It's all the rage these days, just read a couple of popular blogs and you'll be sure to understand what I mean)
<h3>Priorities</h3>
	<p>Whether or not this is for me or for you is still up for debate. I think it can be for both, but I should certainly be honest about the fact that it really is just for me right now.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I need to find a way to develope this while still doing all the other things I need to do. Ideally, I can use this as a place to give value to the random adventures I have reading random things, or learning a little bit about this or that. I'm not trying to absolve myself of the need to focus and specialize, but I really think people specialize because the world says they need to. You have to be a something-ist, you have to have "an area of expertise"-- but let's face it, that's just a way we help eachother feel like we're not entirely useless. The specialist (for the most part) is just the person that has a license to bulshit on a particular topic.</p>
	<h3>To the contrarian</h3>
	<p>You're certainly right in disagreeing with the details above, and the fact that I'm ranting about them here (on the <i>About</i> page) is representative, BUT I'm a little right. There's a grey area here, let's just leave it at that.</p>
	<p></p><p>Well, that's about it for now. Enjoy.</p>
