	<h1>Taping; <i>things together</i></h1>
	<p>This is an exciting time for me. I'm putting together a series of things. I've had ideas about making a website for a while now, and I've never been able to follow through on any of it; but here we are. I'm making it again. Using free resources and nothing but my shotty knowledge of html.<p>
	<h3>The point</h3>
	<p>There are a terrifying number of websites out there, why should this one exist? No reason really, and its not because I'm a nihilist, its just that any reason I might project would be more optimistic than I'd like to be. I'm deliberatly creating this without reasons in mind. Just gonna write some stuff etc... Let me know what you think!</p>
	<h3>The execution</h3>
	<p>I'm using FreeDNS to give myself the name "tape.awiki.org", and I'm using freehosting.com to host the files. I still have to figure some things out, but hey, wish me luck!</p>
	<h3>The information</h3>
	<p>I'm just a college kid doing shit, passing the time. Maybe I'll write about things I think about, I'll probably write about the interent and the world. It'll be kind of dumb, but kind of cool. <br /><br />Toon in next week for, "What the hell is on my shoe?" with Wade Waterson, recipient of the 2016 Nobel Prize in gum spitting.<br /><br />From WSO5 Sante Fe, this is AM internet with Mark Weathers, <br />Good night.
